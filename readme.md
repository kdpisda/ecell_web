## About Entrepreneurship Cell NIT Raipur

The Entrepreneurship Cell, NIT Raipur is a place for all those who avoid taking repeated paths and believe in leaving trails in all walks of life. This cell is aimed at developing entrepreneurial traits among the students, help budding entrepreneurs achieve their goals, as well as engage in some real life projects which could be beneficial to the society. Not only do we at E-Cell show you the doors of opportunity but we also help you to walk through it by providing resources such as new ideas, funding mentoring, networking with other entrepreneurs frequent interactive sessions and Competitions.
If you have the entrepreneurial spark, we make sure that it bursts with full- fledged support from the institute; the Cell finds itself as a tide that would lift all the boats that come in its path.

We at E- Cell believe in getting down to the brass tacks right away, create individuals and enterprises that are ready to take on the challenges in this cut-throat competitive world and do not melt down under the broad daylight. This objective is effectively met through our ground- level processes of networking student enterprises from campus to incubators, seeding funds and investors in order to support the newly born enterprises in their endeavours, and gradually lead them to figure as “GROUND BREAKING STARTUPS OF THE WORLD”.
