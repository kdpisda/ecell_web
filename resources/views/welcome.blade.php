                    <p>Entrepreneurship Cell is a committee in NIT Raipur working towards promoting Entrepreneurship in Chhattisgarh. It is also working towards to promote a start-up culture among denizens of NIT Raipur and to provide them all the facilities they will need to start-up.
                        <p>Our aim is to connect budding start-ups in Chhattisgarh with investors and clients in India. E-Cell achieves its goals by organizing various workshops, seminars and events. Our Flagship Event “E-Summit” and “B-Plan” have benefitted a lot of people and has provided them with the motivation and push needed to start up.

                            <p>We aim to target potential entrepreneurs in Chhattisgarh. These mainly include the students of NIT Raipur, IIIT Raipur, IIM Raipur, HNLU Raipur, SSIPMT, BIT Durg and other colleges in India.
                                <p>The Entrepreneurship Summit is not just an event to provide platform where the students, faculty, investors, participants, speakers and start-ups can interact with each other and gain traction to improve them. We believe in a growth where everyone grows together and hence is this summit. The bright minds shall gain the motivation, resources and the pathway to realize their potential and convert their ideas into innovative start-ups.

                    <h3 class="heading text-center">Need</h3>
                    <p>The Entrepreneurship Summit is needed because of the following reasons:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Motivates young minds to innovate and use their potential.</li>
                            <li>Introduces and provides students the interaction with industry leaders and experts.</li>
                            <li>Provides knowledge about existing schemes helpful to start-ups</li>
                            <li>Introduces the concept of investment and funding to relevant audience</li>
                            <li>Introduces new fields of technology and provides hands on experience in the fields to innovate</li>
                            <li>Provides interaction with implemented start-ups and networking among them and the students as well </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Well established E-Cells such as those of IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bombay yearly organize an Entrepreneurship Summit and it has proved effective in yielding out entrepreneurs from the respective regions of these colleges. E-Cell NIT Raipur looks forward to replicate the same.
                            <p>Target Population of competition is the budding engineers. Most of the students are new to the concept of entrepreneurship and hence they have no idea as how to convert their path breaking ideas into production and thereby into a successful business venture. The primary focus of the Entrepreneurship Summit is to address this problem. It focuses first on motivating the students and introducing them the concept of entrepreneurship and then enables them to have interaction with established entrepreneurs and innovators across the country to learn from them and grow.
